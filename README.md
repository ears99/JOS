# JOS (Jacob Operating System)
A small operating system I'm writing in NASM (Netwide Assembly). Feel free to add to it!
I followed a tutorial series on YouTube by the user theMike97_.

# What inspired me to create JOS?
I honestly wanted more experience with Assembly, considering I'm mainly a C++ programmer, so why not make an operating system?

# I want to run/contribute to JOS! How can I run JOS? 
You'll need QEmu, a free emulator for all kinds of processor architechtures. JOS is run on x86-64, so you'll need a 64-bit processor to be able to contribute (or to run it on actual hardware). To run using QEmu, type *make run* in the terminal.

# My computer isn't x86-64! How can I run JOS? 
I plan to learn how to make an x86 version of JOS, don't worry. Updates to that will be made in another repository called JOS32.
(Assuming I can even find x86 resources online anymore...)
